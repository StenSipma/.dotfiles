# NOTE: Run this command with `.`/`source` as this makes use of the `cd`
#       command. It is recommended to make an alias like:
#	  alias mkcd='. make-change-dir'
#  	in your .bashrc file

# Helper function for printing an error message
errprint() {
	>&2 echo "$1"
}

# Check if there is an argument given
[[ -n $1 ]] || errprint "No argument given"

# Make directory (let mkdir check for errors concerning existing filenames)
mkdir $1

# If directory was created successfully (status = 0)
# --> change into it
[[ $? -eq 0 ]] && cd $1
